            <p>In the summer, the snow-capped peaks give way to
                clear trails, making it the perfect season to
                explore the alpine terrain. Late spring and
                early summer are ideal for lower-altitude hikes,
                while July and August are prime months for
                high-altitude adventures.</p>
